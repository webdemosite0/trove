/**
 * The public pages, one per capability.
 *
 * Every claim here describes something the app actually does today. That rules
 * a few things out on purpose: Automation is not here because it renders a
 * "Coming soon" screen, and there are no numbers about customers, uptime or
 * time saved anywhere on these pages, because there is nothing to measure yet
 * and an invented figure is the fastest way to lose a reader who checks.
 *
 * The tone is deliberately plain. A search result competing on "AI website
 * builder" is not won with adjectives — the reader wants to know what comes
 * out the other end and whether they can download it.
