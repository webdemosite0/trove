 * Shown instead of a blank 500 when the database cannot be reached, and
 * instead of the app when the database will not survive the next restart.
 *
 * A misconfigured deploy previously rendered Vercel's generic "This page
 * couldn't load", which says nothing actionable — the real cause only existed
 * in the function logs. Every page in the app reads the account and credit
 * balance, so one missing variable took the whole site down silently.
 *
 * The "ephemeral" case is worse than being down, which is why it stops here
 * too. The app appears to work: you sign up, you use it, and then a refresh
 * lands on a different instance whose /tmp was never written to, so the
 * account and everything in it is simply gone. Better to say so than to keep
 * accepting data it is going to lose.
