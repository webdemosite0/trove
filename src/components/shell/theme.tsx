 * Runs before first paint, inlined into <head>. Without it the page renders in

 * every request that reaches the server. Kept tiny and dependency-free: it is
 * parsed and executed on the critical path.
 *
 * Light is the default, and "system" is a stored choice rather than the
 * absence of one.
 *
 * Leaving nothing stored used to mean "follow the OS", which made the product
 * dark for anyone whose machine is dark — a different first impression from
 * the one it is designed around. Now: nothing stored means light; picking
 * System writes "system", which removes the attribute and lets the
 * prefers-color-scheme rules take over.
 *
 * Storing the third option is what keeps the toggle honest — otherwise a fresh
 * visitor sees a light page with "System" highlighted.
