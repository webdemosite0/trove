/**
 * What a list looks like before it has anything in it.
 *
 * Deliberately says what to do next rather than only what is missing: "No
 * agents yet" is a dead end, "Build your first agent" plus a button is a
 * starting point.
 *
 * Takes either a plain `icon`, which is framed in the usual circle, or a whole
 * `illustration` for pages that have a drawing of their own — the agents page
 * has one, and swapping it for a generic glyph to fit the primitive would make
 * the page worse.
 *
 * `action` is a node rather than an href so this stays a server component:
 * most of these sit on server-rendered pages, and the one caller that needs a
 * click handler passes its own client button in.
