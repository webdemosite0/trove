    q: "What is Trove?",
    a: "An AI workspace. You describe what you need and Trove plans it, builds it and keeps it — websites, documents, spreadsheets, decks, code, research and agents, from one place.",
  },
  {
    q: "What can I build with it?",
    a: "A complete static website, a Vite + React app, an Express or FastAPI service, Word documents, Excel workbooks, PowerPoint decks, runnable code, research write-ups, and agents that carry out multi-step work.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an account?",
    a: "No. You can start without one and everything works. An account is what makes your work persist across devices and browsers.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do credits work?",
    a: "Credits are metered on the tokens a request actually uses, so a short answer costs less than a long one. The free plan includes 200 credits a month, which is roughly 200k tokens.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Trove create real files?",
    a: "Yes — genuine .docx, .xlsx, .pptx and .zip files, generated in your browser and downloaded directly. They are real Office files, not a copy button, and open in Word, Excel and PowerPoint.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I create AI agents?",
    a: "Yes. Each agent gets its own brief, its own chat page and its own saved history. You can also put a team of four specialists on a single task and get an answer from each discipline.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    a: "The free plan needs no card at all, so there is nothing to cancel. Paid plans are monthly.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who makes Trove?",
    a: "A small studio. There is no sales team and no invented customer logos. Write to official@troveai.site — a person reads that inbox.",
