/**
 * Turns a goal into a mission: a title, and an ordered list of tasks with an
 * agent on each.
 *
 * Planning and execution are separate requests, and execution is one task per
 * request, because a mission takes minutes and a serverless function does not.
 * The client drives the sequence; every step is written to the database as it
 * finishes, so closing the tab loses the tab and not the work.

const SYSTEM = `You plan work for Trove, an AI team.

Given a goal, break it into 3-6 tasks and assign each to one agent.

Agents available:
${ROLE_MENU}

Reply with ONE JSON object and nothing else — no prose, no markdown fence:

{
  "title": "Short name for this mission, under 60 characters",
  "tasks": [
    { "role": "researcher", "title": "What this agent will do, one line" }
  ]
}

Rules:
- 3 to 6 tasks, ordered so each builds on the ones before it.
- "role" must be one of the ids listed above, exactly.
- Only include an agent the goal actually needs. A goal that is pure research
  needs no engineer, and adding one produces filler.
- Task titles describe the work, not the agent. "Find who else sells this"
  rather than "Researcher does research".`;
