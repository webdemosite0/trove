/**
 * The public pages: everything a visitor can read without an account.
 *
 * A separate group from the app because these share the marketing chrome and
 * nothing else — no rail, no credit meter, no session. They are also the only
 * pages in the site that belong in a search index, which is easier to keep
 * true when they live together.
 *
 * Deliberately no redirect for signed-in visitors. The landing page sends them
 * to /chat, which is right for the front door; doing it here would mean
 * someone with an account could never read the pricing page.
