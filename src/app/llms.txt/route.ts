## What it does

- **AI agents** — create agents with a name, role, instructions and tool list.
  The instructions become that agent's system prompt, so it stays in character.
- **AI team** — four specialists (architect, designer, engineer, QA) work one
  task in sequence, each seeing what the previous produced.
- **Documents** — generates a document and exports a genuine Word .docx.
- **Spreadsheets** — generates a table into an editable grid and exports a
  genuine Excel .xlsx, with numbers written as numeric cells.
- **Code, slides, design specs, research** — each has its own system prompt.
- **Reminders** — persisted, delivered through the browser Notification API,
  with an in-app fallback when notifications are blocked.

## Honest limitations

- Google sign-in is not enabled; it needs OAuth credentials that are not
  configured.
- The 76 listed integrations record a connection choice but do not complete an
  OAuth handshake, so no third-party data actually flows. Supabase is the
  exception: its connection is live and its status is queried on page load.
- Plan selection is stored against the account, but no payment processor is
  connected and nothing is charged.
- Scheduled/background tasks are not implemented; reminders fire while the app
  is open in a tab.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS v4, Google Gemini
for generation, SQLite via node:sqlite for storage.
