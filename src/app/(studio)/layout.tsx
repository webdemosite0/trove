/**
 * The tool layout: the same chrome as the rest of the workspace.
 *
 * This group used to render full-bleed, on the reasoning that a builder is a
 * workspace rather than a page inside one. That holds for the moment a build
 * is actually running and the preview wants every pixel — but it also took the
 * navigation away from the library screens that live at these paths, so
 * Documents and Research were the only places in the app you could not get to
 * Agents from. They carry the rail now, like everything else.
 *
 * The group still exists rather than being folded into (shell): the routes
 * under it are the ones that open a full-bleed editor, and keeping them
 * grouped is what lets that editor take the screen back later without moving
 * every URL.
 *
 * The auth gate is the same one the shell uses — see components/shell/guard.
